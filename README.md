# IL2MI2 

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3.

IL2MI2 (I like to move it move it) is an interface designed to use a certain service, that allows you to see a predefine route to a certain destination.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Mock API server

Go to ./server to launch the mock API. `npm install` then `npm start`. Mock API will be running at `http://localhost:8080/`

## To get started

Make sure both servers are launched in your terminal.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
Then write down your origin and destination on the top form, press submit.
